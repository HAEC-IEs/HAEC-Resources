# HAEC Resources

The Humanitarian Assistance Evidence Cycle (HAEC) Associate Award works to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency food security activities funded by the USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) by increasing the use of cost-effective and timely impact evaluations in humanitarian contexts. Impact evaluations provide robust evidence to inform technical approaches to improve the impact of humanitarian interventions.

HAEC is a three-year activity (2021-2024) funded by USAID/BHA and issued through the IDEAL Leader with Associate Awards Activity, implemented by TANGO International, in collaboration with Save the Children, 3ie, and Causal Design. 

Here you can find relevant code and survey and consent form templates for conducting humanitarian impact evaluations.
